## Movie Recommendation App

**Overview**
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning algorithms. 
It suggests movies based on the input movie title provided by the user. 
The app integrates a machine learning model trained on movie data, allowing users to discover new movies similar to their preferences.
<br>

**The project includes two main components:**

app.py: A Streamlit application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the recommendation system.
<br>
Jupyter Notebook: A notebook containing the detailed implementation of the machine learning model, data preprocessing, and exploratory analysis.
<br>
**Libraries Used**
<br>
* Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
* Numpy: For numerical computations.
* Scikit-learn: For TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculations.
* Streamlit: For building the web app interface.
* Jupyter: For the development and testing of the recommendation model.
